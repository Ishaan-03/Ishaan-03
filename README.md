I'm a passionate full-stack web developer specializing in JavaScript with a knack for building scalable, impactful solutions on the web. My expertise spans across React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express, and Cloudflare Worker.js (serverless backends), with databases like PostgreSQL, Prisma, Mongoose, and MongoDB powering my projects.
